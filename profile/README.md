# NARAKA: BLADEPOINT Wallhack 🧠

### See Through Walls, Track Enemies & Loot Like a Ninja Assassin

In **NARAKA: BLADEPOINT**, awareness is everything. You could be mid-heal and get surprise-slashed, or third-partied the moment you drop your ult. But with **Wallhack (ESP)** enabled, you're no longer guessing. You're **tracking players, spotting loot, and watching health bars from across the map**. 👀⚔️

Whether you're a stealthy solo or a sweaty trio carry, this cheat flips the game by giving you **full vision control**—even when enemies think they’re hidden.

## 🧩 What Does the Wallhack Do?

The **ESP (Extra Sensory Perception)** system renders enemy outlines, item markers, trap positions, and monster spawns **through any wall or surface**. It overlays this info in real-time, so you always know **where to strike or escape**.

This isn't just wall vision—it's a tactical nuke for your brain. 🧠💥
